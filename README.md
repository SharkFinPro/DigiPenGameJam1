*Game Overview*
High Concept (Elevator Pitch)
	Weave through a shipwreck with your trusty harpoon gun in hand.
Game Summary
	Underwater, 2D sidescroller, where the player, wearing a heavy diving suit, needs to use their harpoon gun to grapple along the seafloor and the inner workings of a sunken ship, collecting doubloons and smashing obstacles in their way.

*Gameplay*
First Minutes
That they're underwater, they move slower than above water, and are somewhat sluggish. They start on the sea floor with seeing the ship in the distance. Almost right away, there will be a wall impeding the player's progress that they will need to use the harpoon to get past.
Game Flow
Starts outside the ship, chilling on the sea floor, low risk and mainly a tutorial. After the first level, the player moves inside the ship, and is put in a much more cramped and dangerous place.
Victory/Lose Conditions
Get to the end of the level. You lose by touching enemies and obstacles, or getting crushed by falling debris.

*Target Audience*
Casual players of all kinds, nothing that is excessively hard. No major restrictions, anyone can play!
